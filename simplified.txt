Hello, everyone.
This is Andy Arias. He is an actor and he speaks up for people's rights.
Happy 30th anniversary of the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act).
I want to say a quick hello and thank you to disabilityunite.org.
Thank you for making the event great.
Thank you, Corey and Elizabeth, for asking me to be here.
It is almost November. This is important because it is the time to vote. Voting is when you choose leaders or decide on laws. It's your chance to have a say. Voting is important for everyone.
It's very important now to make good choices and to speak up.
It's important for everyone to share their voice by voting in November. Whether your beliefs are more conservative (right) or more liberal (left), it matters that you take part.
Know where to vote.
You can vote even if you can't go to the voting place. You can do this by using an absentee ballot. This means you can mail in your vote. Also, there might be different ways to vote depending on the situation.
We are the biggest group of people, no matter if we are few or many. It's important that we all have the same chance to speak and make choices.
Remember to vote in November.
If I didn't say anything, would you see me?
4 Wheel City is called "The Movement."   - It's a group or project. - Their name is simple and easy to understand. - "The Movement" means they are doing something important together.
This is a short, basic course to help you remember things you have learned before.
We all go in different cars, right?
- Cars - Trucks - Bicycles - Wheelchairs - Motorized wheelchairs - Canes - Crutches  These are all things people use to move around. Some, like cars and trucks, are big and need a driver. Bicycles are smaller and you pedal them to go. Wheelchairs help people who can't walk well, and some have motors. Canes and crutches help people walk when they need extra support.
Please be careful and make changes as needed so everyone can reach where they need to go safely.
Right now is a special time. It is different from other times.
4 Wheel City is taking a moment to say thank you.
Four Wheel City is a place.
Thank you for spending the evening with us.
My name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin. I said this to you earlier.
Of course! Please provide the text you need simplified, and I will do my best to make it easier to understand.
We all take in the same air.
We all live together in the same place.
Maya Angelou once said that we all have a lot in common. This means we share many things with each other.   When you write, remember:  - Use easy words. - Make sentences short. - Do not use hard words that are about special topics. - If you must use a hard word, explain it in a simple way. - Keep the same meaning as the first message. - Do not add new things. - Do not take out important things. - Write clearly and straight to the point. - If you have a list, use bullet points. - Be kind and fair in your writing. - Do not guess who people are. - Only write what the text says.
Have a great summer.
Stay safe.
The text "We love you" is already simple and does not require further simplification. It is a clear and direct expression of affection.
Thank you for being here with us.
Goodbye! See you later.
Good evening, everyone. Welcome to the Disability Unite Festival.
Hello, I'm Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin.
I am very glad to be with you tonight.
We have all been waiting for this time.
This is a very important moment called "It Just Had to be Said".
In the next part, all of us artists will share messages about:  - Speaking up about the events of 2020. - Talking about everyone, including you and me. - Sharing our feelings of being scared and angry. - Showing we won't give up. - Changing how we see ourselves.
These artists will show you and tell you the truth.
I am happy to share some things about me with you.
Hello! I'm Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin. I perform poetry and spoken-word on stage.
The piece I wrote and perform is called "Global Drinks."
This place is to remember people who have died. These people are heroes to us. They used to be part of our families and communities. Now, they are no longer with us. They left behind their families, like:  - Husbands or wives - Children - Grandparents - Older people  We remember them here even though they are gone.
Global Libations is about drinks from all over the world. Here's what you need to know:  - "Global" means from many different places on Earth. - "Libations" are drinks, usually ones that people enjoy in a group, like at a party or a celebration.  We're talking about drinks that people from many countries like to have. These can be things like:  - Coffee from Brazil - Tea from China - Wine from France  Remember, this is about enjoying drinks from everywhere, sharing them with friends, and learning about different cultures through what they drink.
Zazel O'Garra started and leads the ZCO Dance Project. She is a strong and important person in dance.
She is very strong in the art world.
She cannot be slowed down. She cannot be stopped.
Zazel cannot be stopped.
She is amazing.
Her dancers jump and move in ways that look like they are not heavy or held down by the force that pulls us towards the earth.
They easily move from one place to another and from one time to another.
They always keep going and don't stop.
They are very determined. They do not let anything stop them.
In the new dance called "We the People," made by Wendy Powell, you can see what I mean.
Raise your hands up.
Sure, please provide the text you would like me to simplify.
The ZCO Dance Project is coming to you soon.
Certainly! Please provide the text you would like me to simplify.
Hello, Andrea.
Welcome to our Disability Night event.
Thank you for coming today.
We are happy you are here.
You are called the seated nurse.
Sure, I can talk about myself and my disability. Here is my story:  - I am a person with a disability. - This disability is part of my life. - It affects how I do things every day. - But it's just one part of who I am.  If you need to know more, please ask specific questions. I'm here to help you understand.
I am the nurse sitting down.
I am the first nurse in New York City who finished nursing school while using a wheelchair. Here is a little about me: I have a condition called transverse myelitis (it affects the spine and can cause problems with movement).
When I was five years old, doctors found out I had a condition. By the time I was 12, I could no longer walk.
Here is the text simplified:  - Use easy words and short sentences. - Don't use hard words or special words for jobs. - If you have to use a hard word, tell what it means in a simple way. - Keep the same meaning as the first text. - Don't put in new things or leave out important stuff. - Talk clearly and straight to the point. - Make long sentences shorter. - Use bullet points to list things when you can. - Be nice and don't take sides. - Don't guess people's names or who they are. - Just say what the text says, nothing more.
You have a lot of talent. You are very good at what you do.
I have known you for many years.
You have been called Miss Wheelchair New York. This is a title given to a woman who uses a wheelchair and who represents the state of New York. She can be a role model and speak for others who use wheelchairs.
Why did you choose to be a nurse?
I did not always want to be a nurse.
We talked before about what it means to show different kinds of people in things like movies and books, right?
I did not see nurses who were like me. I did not see nurses who:  - Were women, - Were women of color, - Had a disability like mine.
I wanted to become a doctor.
Before, I wanted to be a lawyer.
I wanted to reach my goals in life. I thought about helping others and being useful to someone.
In medical school, you learn to:  - Treat sicknesses. - Understand how sicknesses affect a person's body.
I did not want to act like a person was just a sickness.
I wanted to care for people like they are important individuals. That's why being a nurse was a good choice for me.
Do you think that being a nurse who uses a wheelchair has any good points? Like, can you connect with patients better when you meet them?
Sure! Here is the simplified text:  - Always use easy words. - Make sentences short. - Don't use hard words or special work words. - If you must use a hard word, explain it in an easy way. - Keep the meaning the same. - Don't add new things. - Don't leave out important things. - Speak or write clearly. - If you have a list, use bullet points. - Be nice and don't take sides. - Don't guess who people are or what their names mean. - Just use what the text says.
When you sit or have a disability, you see things differently. This view can help others understand things they might not think about.  - Sitting or having a disability gives you a unique way of looking at things. - This unique view can be helpful to others.
Some people think that having a disability means a person can't live a good life. But that's not true.
When you are a nurse and you already have a disability, you understand that there is more to life than just being in a hospital or clinic.
You are giving people new hope. This hope might not come from a doctor or nurse who does not have a disability.
It's a new way of looking at things.
We are people who create new things. So, there is a special benefit for us.
We know how to plan far ahead.
Sure, I can help with that. Please provide the text you would like simplified.
You were recently working where COVID-19 was a big problem.
Sure! I can talk about that. Here's what I've done:  - I've tried to make things easy to understand. - When I talk or write, I use simple words. - I do not use hard words or special work words. - If I have to use a hard word, I explain it in an easy way. - I keep my sentences short. - I talk about one idea at a time. - I don't add new things. - I don't leave out important things. - I am clear and say things straight. - When I list things, I might use bullet points. - I am always respectful and fair. - I don't guess who someone is or what they are like.   My goal is to help everyone understand what I'm saying.
COVID-19 spread very quickly in New York, just like a tornado moves fast and causes a lot of damage.
Many people have died. Many people are sick. Many people are getting better. This will keep happening for a long time.
People say things have changed and this is how it will be from now on.
I don't want this to be normal.
We do not want to be stuck inside.
We don't want our family or friends to get sick from COVID. It can make our bodies feel very bad.
People with disabilities often know what it's like to:  - Not go out much - Feel left out - Worry about going to the hospital or clinic  Because of this, they might understand the situation better. Right?
We can get used to it a bit more than most people.
Now, we can say that we understand what this is like.
Tell us your stories.
We all need to help each other because we have to face this together.
Here is the simplified text:  - Use easy words and short sentences. - Don't use hard words or special words used in jobs like medicine or law. - If you must use a hard word, tell what it means in a simple way. - Keep the meaning the same. - Don't add new things or leave out important stuff. - Write clearly and straight to the point. - Make long sentences shorter. - Use lists with bullet points when you can. - Be nice and fair in your writing. - Don't guess who people are or what their names mean. - Only talk about what the text says. Don't guess or add your own ideas.
Here are some tips for everyone during the pandemic:  - Stay home if you can, especially if you are feeling sick. - Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. - Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available. - Keep away from people who are not from your household. Try to stay at least 6 feet apart. - Wear a mask over your nose and mouth when you are around others. - Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow, not your hands. - Clean surfaces that you touch a lot like doorknobs and phones. - Get the vaccine for COVID-19 when it's your turn.  Remember, these steps help keep you and others safe.
I know many people have been alone. This might be different from what we usually do.
To stay healthy, it's good to:  - Eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. - Drink water instead of sugary drinks. - Exercise regularly, like walking or playing sports. - Get enough sleep each night. - Stay away from smoking. - Limit alcohol to small amounts. - Take breaks to relax and de-stress.  Always talk to a doctor or a nurse if you have questions about your health.
Stay away from places with lots of people for now.
If you need to go outside, put on a mask.
Make sure to wash your hands often. Here's how to do it well:  - Wet your hands with clean water. - Put soap on your hands. - Rub your hands together to make a lather. Do this for about 20 seconds. Make sure you get the soap on the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails. - Rinse your hands well under running water. - Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.  Washing your hands helps get rid of germs.
Make sure to go to all your appointments, okay?
It's important to go to clinics or hospitals when you need to. If you don't go when you're sick or hurt, it could be bad for your health.
Make sure to:  - Visit your doctors often. - Get the care and treatments you need.
To stay healthy, we can do things like:  - Eat good foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. - Drink water instead of sugary drinks. - Move our bodies by walking, running, or playing sports. - Get enough sleep every night. - Keep our hands clean by washing them often. - Go to the doctor for check-ups to make sure we're okay.
We need to talk to our doctors next.
As a nurse who has worked in many places and was there when COVID was at its worst, I want to tell you that they are doing everything they can to keep us safe when we go into those buildings. They are taking a lot of careful steps to protect our health.
Please remember to look after yourself.
Go outside.
- Pick up your phone. - Dial your friend's number. - Wait for them to answer. - Talk to your friend.
Remember, you have people who can help you. You are not by yourself.
Please provide the text you would like simplified, and I will be happy to help.
Not necessarily. The choice to travel in separate vehicles or together depends on the context and the preferences of the travelers involved.

Here are a few common situations:

1. **Personal Travel**: Friends or family members might choose to travel together in one vehicle to a destination for convenience, to save on fuel, or to enjoy each other's company.

2. **Business Travel**: Colleagues might travel together to a meeting or event if they are starting from the same location. However, they might also travel separately if they are coming from different places or have different schedules.

3. **Public Transportation**: Many people travel together in the same vehicle when using public transportation, such as buses, trains, or airplanes.

4. **Carpooling**: Individuals might organize carpools for daily commutes or special events to reduce the number of vehicles on the road, which can save money and reduce environmental impact.

5. **Events**: For events like weddings or parties, guests might travel separately or some might arrange to travel together, especially if parking is limited or if they plan to consume alcohol and want to designate a driver.

In summary, whether people travel in separate vehicles or together can depend on a variety of factors, including the purpose of the trip, the relationship between the travelers, environmental considerations, and practical logistics.It appears you've listed various modes of transportation and mobility aids.

While I can provide advice and suggestions, please note that my capabilities as a digital assistant are limited to providing information. I am not able to physically intervene or make changes to real-world systems. However, here are some general tips for coordinating group travel or movement:

1. **Clear Communication**: Make sure everyone involved knows the plan. Use group chats or emails to keep everyone updated.

2. **Set a Schedule**: Establish clear times for departure, arrival, and any other important checkpoints along the way.

3. **Assign Roles**: If the group is large, assign roles to different people. For example, someone could be in charge of navigation, while another person could manage accommodations.

4. **Contingency Plans**: Have a backup plan in case something goes wrong, like missed connections or delays.

5. **Gather Necessary Information**: Ensure that everyone has the required documents, tickets, or any other necessary items for the trip.

6. **Check Transportation and Traffic Updates**: If driving, check for traffic updates. If using public transportation, verify the schedules and any service advisories.

7. **Be Flexible**: Sometimes, despite the best planning, things can go awry. Be prepared to adjust the plan as needed.

8. **Allow Extra Time**: Always factor in some buffer time for unforeseen delays.

It reminds us that despite our differences in culture, race, religion, or geography, there are fundamental aspects of our existence that unite us.

This concept can also be an appeal to collective responsibility when it comes to taking care of the environment, as air quality affects everyone. It stresses the importance of working together to protect our planet and ensure that the air remains clean and healthy for all to breathe.That's a profound statement. It can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context:

1. **Philosophical or Spiritual Context**: The idea that all living beings are connected and that we share the same physical space on Earth or the same spiritual space in the universe.

2. **Environmental Context**: A reminder of our shared responsibility to care for our planet, as we all rely on the same finite resources and ecosystems.

3. **Social or Sociological Context**: An acknowledgment that we live in a society with others, and our actions can affect everyone else within that space.

4. **Astronomical or Cosmic Context**: A reflection on the fact that we all exist together in the vastness of the cosmos, sharing the same tiny planet in a vast universe.

5. **Urban or Community Planning**: An emphasis on the importance of designing shared spaces that are inclusive and beneficial for all members of a community.

6. **Workplace or Collaborative Context**: A reminder that in many environments, such as offices or collaborative projects, we need to work together harmoniously in the same physical or virtual space.

The statement can serve as a call to unity, understanding, and cooperation, recognizing that our actions have implications for others and the world around us.Maya Angelou was renowned for her wisdom and her ability to capture profound truths in simple yet powerful language. While I don't have a record of her saying the exact phrase "we have more in common than we realize," this sentiment is consistent with her messages of empathy, understanding, and human connection.

Throughout her work, Maya Angelou explored themes of compassion, shared humanity, and the bonds that unite people across different backgrounds. Her perspective encouraged people to look beyond superficial differences and recognize the common threads that bind us all—our emotions, experiences, and innate human dignity.

Her often-quoted statements and writings invite us to listen to each other's stories, learn from one another, and respect our shared humanity. Angelou's life and work serve as a reminder of the importance of seeing beyond division and embracing the commonalities that can bring us together.Thank you!

How can I help you tonight?Your statement seems to suggest that there is a significant event or occasion that has been awaited by many. Could you please provide more details or context about this moment? This will help me understand better and provide a more relevant response or assistance.The phrase "It Just Had to be Said" suggests a situation where someone felt compelled to express a thought, opinion, or fact that was either uncomfortable, taboo, or otherwise left unspoken. This can occur in various contexts, such as during a meeting, within a family gathering, or among friends, where the tension is palpable and something needs to be addressed to clear the air, provide clarity, or confront an issue head-on.

When someone declares "It just had to be said," they're taking a stand, often at the risk of causing upset or controversy, because they believe the importance of the message outweighs the potential fallout. It can be a moment of truth-telling, whistleblowing, or simply honesty that breaks through politeness or avoidance. The statement can be met with relief, anger, acknowledgment, or a range of other responses from those who hear it.

The specific circumstances, the way the message is delivered, and the content of the message itself can significantly influence the outcome of such a moment. It can be a turning point in a discussion, leading to either a positive breakthrough or a more challenging confrontation.It sounds like you're describing a collective artistic response to the events and circumstances of the year 2020. This year was marked by significant global challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, social and political unrest, economic hardship, and a heightened awareness of systemic racial injustices. Artists often play a crucial role in times of upheaval, using their work to reflect the moment, provoke thought, offer critique, and inspire change.

In creating a segment that addresses these issues, you and the other artists are likely exploring various emotions and themes that emerged during 2020:

- **Protest**: Art can be a powerful tool for expressing dissent and rallying people around a cause. Artists might create work that challenges the status quo, questions authority, or stands in solidarity with movements for social justice.

- **Fear**: With the uncertainty brought on by the pandemic and other events, fear was a prevalent emotion. Artistic expressions might delve into the collective anxiety experienced during the year.

- **Outrage**: In response to perceived injustices, particularly those related to systemic racism and police brutality, many people felt a deep sense of anger. Art that captures this outrage can be confrontational and raw.

- **Defiance**: As a reaction to oppressive systems or policies, defiance is often a theme in protest art. Works could embody resistance, resilience, and the refusal to accept injustice.

- **Redefining Identities**: In the face of these challenges, many individuals and communities have had to re-examine and redefine their identities. Art can explore these shifts, the negotiation between the personal and political, and the forging of new understandings of self and community.

As an artist participating in this segment, you'll want to consider how your work interacts with these themes. Think about the message you want to convey, the emotions you wish to evoke, and the conversations you hope to spark. Your art can serve as a catalyst for reflection, dialogue, and even action.

If you're looking for advice on how to articulate these themes or on the practical aspects of creating and presenting your work, feel free to ask for more specific guidance.Your phrase seems like an introduction to a group of artists known for their straightforward, no-nonsense approach to their art. When someone says that artists "bring it to you and tell you just like it is," they are typically referring to artists whose work is known for being honest, direct, and perhaps even raw or unfiltered. These artists don't sugarcoat their message; instead, they present their thoughts and feelings in a way that is meant to be clear and impactful.

If you're looking to discuss specific artists who fit this description, you might think of musicians like Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, or Tupac Shakur, who are known for their candid lyrics. In visual arts, someone like Frida Kahlo or Jean-Michel Basquiat might be mentioned for their direct and expressive styles. Writers such as Charles Bukowski or Hunter S. Thompson could be included for their blunt prose.

If you're referencing a particular group of artists or a genre, please provide more details so I can give you more specific information.That sounds great! I'm here to listen.

Would you like feedback, advice on where to perform or share it, tips on promotion, or something else?It sounds like you are reflecting on or planning a memorial to honor the lives of individuals who have passed away, leaving a void in the lives of their loved ones and communities. Memorials serve as a way to remember and celebrate the lives of those who have made an impact on us, whether they were widely recognized heroes or 'sheroes' (a term often used to specifically highlight female heroes), or simply beloved family members, friends, and pillars of local communities.

Creating a memorial can involve various elements, such as:

1. **Location**: Choosing a significant place where loved ones and community members can gather to remember those who have passed.

2. **Tributes**: Providing opportunities for people to share stories, anecdotes, and memories of the individuals being honored.

3. **Visual Memorials**: Erecting plaques, statues, or creating a memorial wall with photos and names of the departed.

4. **Ceremonies**: Organizing a formal event with readings, music, and moments of silence to reflect on the lives and contributions of the departed.

5. **Legacy Projects**: Initiating scholarships, charitable foundations, or community projects in the name of those who have passed, to continue their positive impact.

6. **Support**: Offering support and resources for the grieving families and friends, such as counseling or support groups.

7. **Continued Remembrance**: Establishing an annual event or a specific day to remember and honor those who have gone, ensuring that their legacy endures.

In creating a memorial, the most important aspect is to capture the essence of those being remembered, providing comfort to those who mourn, and ensuring that the contributions and memories of the departed continue to inspire and live on in the hearts of their communities."Global Libations" seems like a broad topic that could refer to a variety of drinks from around the world.

true that during certain events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have been hesitant to visit clinics and hospitals for fear of exposure to the virus or due to restrictions put in place to reduce the spread. However, avoiding necessary medical care can indeed lead to poorer health outcomes.

Delaying or avoiding medical care for acute conditions, chronic illnesses, or routine check-ups could lead to complications or the worsening of existing conditions. It's important to consult with healthcare providers about the necessity and timing of medical visits and to follow their advice for maintaining health.

Healthcare facilities have also adapted to the situation by implementing rigorous infection control measures to protect patients and staff, and by offering telemedicine services when appropriate. This allows patients to receive medical advice without having to physically visit a healthcare facility.

If you're in need of medical assistance, it's advisable to:

1. Contact your healthcare provider to discuss your situation and get advice on whether an in-person visit is necessary.
2. Inquire about the possibility of a virtual consultation if you have concerns about going to a healthcare facility.
3. Follow public health guidelines and healthcare facility protocols if you need to visit in person, such as wearing masks, hand hygiene, physical distancing, and pre-visit screenings.
4. Stay informed about current recommendations from public health organizations and updates regarding the safety measures in place at your local healthcare facilities.

The key is not to neglect your health and to seek medical advice when needed while taking appropriate precautions to minimize the risk of infection.It sounds like you're offering a reminder about the importance of maintaining regular healthcare visits and following through with prescribed treatments. While I can't physically go out or schedule appointments, I can certainly provide you with some tips on staying on top of your healthcare:

Here are some steps you might take to effectively follow up with your doctors:

5. **Take Notes**: It can be helpful to take notes during your appointment or bring someone with you to help remember what was discussed.

7. **Ask About Communication**: Inquire how best to communicate with your physician between visits. Some practices use patient portals for non-urgent communication, while others may prefer phone calls.

8. **Manage Medications**: If you've been prescribed new medications, understand how to take them and be aware of potential side effects.

9. **Keep Records**: Keep your own records of all medical appointments, treatments, medications, and test results. This can be invaluable for future appointments or if you see multiple healthcare providers.

If you're relating this to my existence as an AI, I can provide a general response:

As an artificial intelligence, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, so I don't face challenges or have a road to acceptance in the way humans do. However, the development of AI technology and its integration into human communities has certainly been a complex process. Developers, ethicists, and users alike have grappled with various challenges to ensure that AI systems are designed responsibly, operate transparently, and are utilized in ways that are beneficial and acceptable to society.

If you were referring to a specific kind of community or situation, please provide more context, and I'll do my best to give you a more tailored response.The phrase "it definitely was an uphill battle" suggests that whatever task or challenge you are referring to was difficult and required a lot of effort to overcome. The metaphor of an "uphill battle" is often used to describe a situation that is strenuous and fraught with obstacles, much like physically climbing uphill in a battle would be. If you need any advice, further clarification, or support related to the challenge you faced, feel free to ask!Absolutely, you are correct. It is important to recognize that having a disability does not mean an individual is unable to contribute or perform tasks effectively. People with disabilities can and do lead productive, fulfilling lives, and they often possess unique skills and perspectives. It is essential for all professions to promote inclusivity, accessibility, and equal opportunities for individuals with disabilities.

In many places, there are laws and regulations in place to protect the rights of people with disabilities and to ensure they have equal access to employment, education, and public services. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the United States, for example, is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life.

Employers, educators, and service providers need to make reasonable accommodations to ensure that people with disabilities can participate fully. This might include adapting workspaces, providing assistive technology, or modifying communication methods.

Moreover, it is important to challenge stereotypes and misconceptions about disability. Disability awareness and sensitivity training can help individuals and organizations to understand the barriers faced by people with disabilities and to learn how to support them effectively.

In summary, recognizing that disability does not equal inability is crucial for fostering a society that values diversity, respects each person's abilities, and provides equal opportunities for all.Absolutely! Your physical position doesn't limit your ability to offer help or provide service. Whether you're seated due to preference, necessity, or any other reason, there are numerous ways in which you can be of assistance. Let me know how I can help you or what you need assistance with, and I'll do my best to provide you with the information or support you're looking for.It's true that societal biases, including ableism, can often be internalized by individuals within marginalized communities, including people with disabilities. Ableism is the discrimination or prejudice against people who have disabilities, and it can manifest in many ways, from physical barriers to attitudinal barriers.

When people with disabilities internalize ableist ideas, they may doubt their own abilities or feel limited by what they perceive as societal expectations of what they can or cannot do. This can lead to self-imposed limitations, where an individual might not pursue a certain activity or opportunity due to preconceived notions about their abilities, rather than actual limitations.

To combat this internalized ableism, it's important to:

1. **Recognize Internalized Ableism**: The first step is to be aware that these biases exist and can be internalized. By recognizing these thoughts, individuals can begin to question and challenge them.

2. **Affirm Your Abilities**: Focus on what you can do, rather than what you can't. Everyone has strengths and talents, and by acknowledging and developing these, you can build confidence and a more positive self-image.

3. **Seek Role Models**: Finding role models who have similar disabilities and who are achieving goals or participating in activities that you aspire to can be incredibly empowering. It shows that limitations are often not as insurmountable as they may seem.

4. **Advocate for Accommodations**: Sometimes, the only thing standing in the way of participating in an activity is the lack of proper accommodations. Advocating for yourself and others to ensure that necessary accommodations are provided can open up opportunities.

5. **Educate Others**: By educating those around you about the capabilities of people with disabilities and the importance of inclusivity, you can help change societal biases and create more opportunities for participation.

6. **Join Supportive Communities**: Being a part of a community of individuals who share similar experiences can provide a sense of belonging and support. It can be a valuable space for sharing strategies to overcome barriers and celebrate successes.

7. **Practice Self-Compassion**: It's important to be kind to yourself and recognize that internalizing societal biases is a common experience. Practicing self-compassion can help in overcoming negative thoughts and feelings.

Remember that you are not alone in these experiences, and there are many resources and communities available to support you in challenging ableist biases and living a fulfilling life.It seems like you're referring to a common type of query where people are seeking instructions or guidance on how to accomplish a specific task or solve a particular problem.

Everyone has their own unique perspective, which is shaped by their personal experiences, beliefs, and biases. People might perceive us in various ways based on how they interpret our actions and demeanor within the context of their own lives. However, their perceptions do not define our true character or worth.

It is important to be self-aware and strive for personal growth, but it's also crucial to recognize that we cannot control how others perceive us. What defines us is our own set of values, beliefs, intentions, and actions. It's beneficial to listen to constructive feedback and reflect on how we can improve, but it's equally important to not let others' opinions dictate our self-worth or self-identity. Being true to oneself and maintaining a clear sense of who we are is key to personal well-being and authenticity.
